# Web Automation using Selenium and Robot Framework

This is a sample of Sign Up test suit.
I use Page Object Model. Below is a high level of description of hierarchy.

'Script' directory: I created executable test case SignUp.robot. In this directory suppose to store all TestCases.
'Libs' directory:
                 navigationLib.robot file --- All keyword(methods) for this tests are locating in in this file
                 commonLib.robot file --- Most common keywords(methods) that all tests are inheriting
'Setting directory:'
                    Setting.robot file --- In this file I can manipulate with the environment
